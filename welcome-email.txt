Hello Data Carpentry Genomics and Assessment participant!

Thank you so much for participating in this event. We're really looking forward to seeing you soon. 
We wanted to let you know a few logistical details, a couple things you should do before the workshop
 and the general agenda for the workshop.

This information is also available on our wiki for the workshop:

Before the workshop:

- Book your travel! If you haven't done that already please contact ... by ...
- Introduce yourself on the participants page - https://github.com/datacarpentry/genomics-hackathon/wiki/participants
- The first goal of the workshop is to identify the fundamental skills that researchers need to be successful in analyzing and managing genomics data. We've started a Google doc outlining some of these ideas.

Please look at this document and comment or edit with any of your ideas! 

Logistics: 
The workshop will begin at 9am on Monday, March 23. Please plan to be there by that time. The workshop
will run from 9am to about 5pm each day, but we'll have the chance to have dinner together and get
together in the evenings. 

Include travel logistics?

Meeting agenda:
Details on the meeting agenda are here:
https://github.com/datacarpentry/genomics-hackathon/wiki/agenda
Generally though, we will begin with a discussion of learning objectives and define modules as the basis
for break out sections to develop specific learning objectives, assessment methods and materials

Again, we're looking forward to seeing you and please let us know if you have any questions!

Best,
Tracy, Shari, Hilmar, Mary, Mike, Jason
